Description
-----------

MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer. See the main MiniLight
readme for a general description.




Installation
------------

### Requirements ###

* MacOS 10.5, or Windows 2000/XP, or GNU/Linux 2010ish, or later


### Guide ###

Simply copy the minilight-c [mac|lin|win.exe] executable file to wherever.

The program reads the model file given and creates and writes the image file
requested; nothing else is touched.




Usage
-----

This version has a command-line option to generate Radiance RGBE images instead
of PPM P6 images: just add -hdri before the model file name.




Building
--------

It is an ordinary simple build. There are no special requirements or
dependencies: everything needed is in the supplied archive (assuming the normal build environment and tools are already prepared).

However, LLVM-Clang invocation might vary so the build script might need
adjusting.

Choose a build script:
* Mac:     make/build-mac.sh (for LLVM-GCC 4.2 or GCC 4)
* Linux:   make/build-linux.sh (for Clang 3.0 or GCC 4)
* Windows: make\build-windows.bat (for MS VC++ 2008 or 2005)

Run scripts from the 'c' directory.

Appendix:
The code uses double-precision FP and is for 64-bit builds. Changing either the
FP to single-precision or the build to 32-bit probably means it would be best
to change the other too.
